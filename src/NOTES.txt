  //DUBLER 061720    adding external INA226

  i2c_stop();

2) DONE -- cpu is AVR  eliminateed #ifdef AVR

3) DONE -- Change INA226 to INA226-bat  and external_INA226 to INA226-alt

4) DONE -- Scrub smartregulator.h to configure to ATmega2560 MINI PRO EMBED

5) DONE -- do we need CHARGE_PUMP_PORT (likely just for bluetooth)
   system.cpp line 424


6) DONE -- what is RVCMessages.h  used in system.h  ... NMEA2000 stuff
   GET RID OF N2K stuff

7) DONE -- research WDT on ATmega2650

8) DONE -- systemVoltMult in main code.   decide if we need this or not.

9) DONE --decide what functions we want to map to the dip switch.   Set this up in the main code.
   Perhaps add label on board for DIP switch functions  Add tach mode and engine stop function (activate feature_out_3 pulse after X time in float mode)
   

10) DONE -- review DIP switch code.  May be able to ifdef in simpler code since pins are now assigned to a single port.

11) DONE -- Look into #ifdef NTC_FET_PORT (not turned on yet... Pin 7 of Mega board)

12) DONE -- Change feature_out_port to support multiple feature out ports -- continue to complete... now has 
      feature in/out port defines.

13) DONE -- Move serial port for serial display out to a different serial port.  Reserve primary serial port for
    programming and configuring.  CONFIGURE MULTIPLE SERIAL STREAMS

14) On 3D printed case, engrave terminal names.

15) DONE -- have we eliminated all references to AVR and OSE_ALTERNATOR defines?

16/ DONE -- NOTE BOM R1 and R101 are now 10 ohm

17) DONE --Need to implement a failsafe for lithium batteries in the combiner funtion.

18) Confirm that Lifeline profile agrees with Lifeline specs.
