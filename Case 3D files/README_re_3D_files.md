Regarding the case lids and the OLED snap-in mount, I have found that there is some variance in the dimensions of the OLED boards.
To accomodate this, I made the snap clips a bit bigger than might be necessary.  Carefully trim *two* of the clips (I like to trim
the ones closest to the side of the case) slightly with a razor blad to adjust the degree of pressure needed to press your OLED board 
into position.
